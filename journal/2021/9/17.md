First day starting on this project.
First step, try and figure out how to get code running on my new raspberry pi 4.

plug sd card into mac
cd /volumes/boot
touch ssh

wpa_supplicant.conf
```
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
scan_ssid=1
ssid="XXXX"
psk="XXXX"
}
```

take out card, boot up pi.

Cant figure out if i cant find it on wifi, or it's not connected. Trying ethernet instead.

cant connect to it over ethernet either. Maybe i need a monitor? Maybe its dead?

Ordered a screen, and a few more sensors from adafruit.
